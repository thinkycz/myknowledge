I guess now it's the time. Currently, I work as a junior web developer and tester, so primarily I will focus on the tools that we use in the company.

Let's start with PHPStorm. PHPStorm is one of the best IDEs out there, made by a company called JetBrains. I think it is a Czech company, but I'm not sure. It has almost every feature that we need, including Composer integration, version control systems like Git, SVN built in, and most importantly, a great Intellisense. The features can also be customized and added via plugins, that really helps with my overall workflow. Plugins I use are Symfony, Laravel, PHP Annotations and some related to Nette - Latte, Neon.

Next, as a localhost server we use XAMPP, and because at home I use OS X, I also use MAMP. It's the easiest way how to set up a virtual host.

To connect securely to Git server we use Putty SSH and Pageant. I personally didn't know about this type of authorization before I started working.

As a text editor I use Visual Studio Code, or Atom. Believe it or not, VS Code is really great!

For compiling Less we use WinLess. I don't like this approach, since I used to use Sass in combination with Gulp, but since the company uses Less, I must too.

Then we use standard corporate tools from Microsoft, like Outlook, Lync, this kind of stuff.
