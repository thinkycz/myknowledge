So, this idea just came across my mind...to write an article about languages. Hope you like it.

The first language I speak is vietnamese. That's because I was born in Hanoi, and also was raised by my grandparents. I can speak vietnamese fluently most of the time, but when it comes to a more advanced topic, my parents have to explain it to me using just basic vocabulary in order to understand it. Also, there are severalÂ dialects in vietnamese - some of them are very similar to the "official", but there are ones I don't understand at all. Sometimes I listen to vietnamese music, and even sing karaoke in vietnamese, but to be honest, I don't usually understand the meaning of the songs. I primarily use vietnamese to talk to my parents, and my relatives.

The second one is the Czech language. I've been living here since I was 4 years old and my parents wanted me to speak Czech fluently, so I wouldn't be struggling as they did when they came to this new country. So they sent me to a Czech nanny. I remember the first time I met the nanny's family - I was so scared of the new environment. The food was sooo different that I just refused to eat and behaved badly, so the nanny was yelling at me in a language I didn't know back then. And that's how I learned Czech.";s:10:"post_title";s:15:"I am trilingual";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:15:"i-am-trilingual";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-04-15 09:38:57";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-04-15 09:38:57";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:27:"http://myknowledge.eu/?p=20";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
