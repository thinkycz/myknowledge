I am a geek. I have a lot of tech stuff at home, and in this article I'd like to share what I use. As a web developer I use my computer every day. I am a Mac user, I've got a 27" iMac and a Macbook Pro for doing stuff when I'm travelling. I also use a Samsung external monitor. My mouse is a Roccat Kone XTD and I use the keyboard bundled with my iMac.

By the way, the mouse is really great, I definitely remommend this mouse if you are right handed. I will post a detailed review of this mouse in the future.

For speakers, recently I bought the Harman Kardon Soundsticks Wireless, and they sound amazing. I love bass, and these speakers have excellent subwoofers. And they also have a nice, futuristic look.

In the past I experimented doing some iOS programming in Objective-C and Swift. That's why I use an iPhone and iPad. Currently I have an iPhone SE and it suits me really well, as I have small hands. Recently I also bought the Apple Watch, and it's working great so far. I love the feeling when it does the haptic feedback thing. Since then I don't have to check my phone everytime it vibrates in my pocket.

And that's basically it!
